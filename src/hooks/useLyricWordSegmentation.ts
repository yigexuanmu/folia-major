// Keeps the saved word segmentation for the playing song in the store the lyric setter reads.
//
// Clearing first is not a nicety: the setter is synchronous, so between a skip and the new load
// resolving the previous song's record would still be live and could bake itself onto the new
// lyrics for any line whose start time and text happened to match.
//
// The record load and the lyric load race, and either can win. If the record lands first the
// setter picks it up on its own; if the lyrics land first they were built without it, so the
// record is applied to them here. That second path is a pure transform over the lines already in
// the store — not a re-run of the lyric pipeline, which would re-apply the display filter and the
// staff policy to text they have already been applied to.
