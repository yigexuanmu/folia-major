// The mutable substrate the playback controllers coordinate through.
//
// These are not state: nothing renders off them, and writing one must not schedule a render. They
// exist because several hooks - the queue, the transport, the audio graph, the stage bridge, the
// automix decks - need to see each other's in-flight work within the same tick, and a store write
// is one render too late for that.
//
// Collected here so the coupling is one named thing rather than twenty loose `useRef` lines in
// App.tsx. App.tsx still has to be the one that holds it: the controllers are siblings, so their
// shared substrate has to live at their common ancestor.
//
// A ref that only one hook reads does NOT belong here - it belongs inside that hook.
