// separated - the same rule profileService follows, and stricter, because separation is worth less
// than a download nobody agreed to. A non-local track simply has no stems and the transition falls
// back to the master crossfade, which is what every build before this did.
//
// Only a WINDOW is separated, never a whole track, kept at sixteen bits with the peak scaled out. A
// four-minute track is a minute of CPU and a third of a gigabyte of stems; the last thirty seconds is
// about ten seconds and 21MB - see STEM_WINDOW_SEC.

 * Which window to drop when the budget is full: the oldest one NOBODY IS WAITING ON.

 * evicted the tail of the track playing at that moment - the one window the next transition was
 * certain to ask for. That transition then fell back to the crossfade without even re-separating,
 * because the other half of the pair was still cached.
 *
 * The budget was never the problem. The slots hold the pair that is coming and the pair that just
 * played, as the MAX_WINDOWS comment says; what it could not survive was throwing the pair that is
 * coming away to make room for one nobody is waiting on.
 *
 * Falls back to the oldest when everything is wanted, so a stale or empty `wanted` degrades to the
 * plain LRU this replaced rather than to nothing being evictable.
 *
 * `arriving` is the window being stored right now, and it is here because "not wanted" covers two
 * things that are worth opposite amounts. A window the listener has merely STEPPED PAST is next
 * door to where they are and will be asked for again - it is the Previous hit MAX_WINDOWS exists to
 * hold. A window that finished for an excursion they have already LEFT will not be. Age cannot
 * separate them, and it picked the wrong one: measured twice in one session, a tail separated for a
 * track skipped away from six seconds earlier took the last of four slots, evicting a window the
 * very next transition asked for, which was then separated again to the same numbers.
 *
 * The arrival can be told apart, because it is the only one whose own `stillWanted` can still be
 * asked. So it goes first - but ONLY when the budget is actually full. Free is free, and that half
 * is not a nicety, it is the whole difference between this and discarding such a result outright
 * before storing it. That version was written, shipped for a listening test, and was worse: a
 * listener who cancels a blend by seeking stays on the SAME track, so the pair that was being
 * prepared is the pair coming back in a minute. Each cancel threw away ten seconds of htdemucs that
 * the next arm then paid for again - seven model runs across four minutes where this rule needs
 * four. A result that is already paid for costs only a slot, and a slot is what this decides.

/**
 * Which of the two builds this is.
 *
 * The desktop app and the web app run the SAME planner over different evidence, a design decision not
 * a limitation: everything needing a native runtime - the beat grid from Beat This!, the four stems
 * from htdemucs - lives in the Electron main process, so the browser build never gets an answer and
 * falls through to the estimators and the master crossfade it always had. Nothing is disabled and
 * nothing throws; the same code takes a different branch because it was handed less.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in transitionStrategy, its natural home, because that module is imported by
 * a settings STORE and this one reaches the media cache: the edge transitionStrategy -> stems ->
 * resourceCache -> audioCache -> a settings store closes a real cycle, whose symptom is not a warning
 * but `DEFAULT_TRANSITION_SETTINGS` being undefined while the store initialises. Kept out of that graph
 * on purpose.
 *
 * After the store split the two ends are useAutomixSettingsStore (imports transitionStrategy) and
 * useAudioSettingsStore (reached via audioCache). They are different stores now, so the cycle is not
 * currently closed — but moving this back into transitionStrategy would still put a store on both
 * ends of that path, so the reason to keep it here stands.
