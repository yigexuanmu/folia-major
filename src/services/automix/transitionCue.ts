// src/services/automix/transitionCue.ts
// Announces to the screen that a transition is happening, and its shape.
//
// A channel rather than a port on `createAutomixSession`: the audience is a decorative overlay far
// from the decks, and threading a port through would re-render App on every song change just to feed
// a component that draws a circle.
//
// Announced, and the one in flight is also recorded. The announcement is still the primary thing -
// nobody polls this - but there are now two renderers for one blend (the full-screen ring and the
// now playing card's border), and which of them is on screen can change mid-blend: navigating between
// home and the lyrics page, or flipping the card's own setting, unmounts one and mounts the other. A
// renderer that arrives mid-blend and can only wait for the next announcement draws nothing for the
// rest of the transition, which reads as the animation being broken. So a late arrival can ask what
// is in flight, and how far in - see `getActiveTransitionCue`.
