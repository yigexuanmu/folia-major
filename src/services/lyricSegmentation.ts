// Persists the per-song word segmentation a user produced with AI or by hand.
//
// The `lyricSeg_` prefix is chosen, not incidental. Keys starting with `lyric_` are swept by
// cacheRepository's 'lyrics' category, so a user clearing their lyric cache would silently destroy
// work that cost them either money or manual effort. `lyricSeg_` matches no category and lands in
// api_cache through getCacheTableName's fall-through. It IS still removed by "clear all caches",
// which is accepted: that action is explicitly a full reset.
