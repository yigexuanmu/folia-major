// src/services/lyricSegmentationAi.ts
// Renderer-side entry to lyric word segmentation, mirroring the Electron/web split in gemini.ts:
// the desktop build goes through IPC so it can use the model the user configured in settings, and
// the web build posts to the deployment's own endpoint because its credentials live server-side.
//
// The prompt shown to the user for the copy-and-paste path comes from the same shared module the
// three server paths use, so "run it yourself" and "run it for me" ask for identical output.
//
// Requests are batched, but the batch is large enough that a normal song is a single call.
//
// Batching was originally added because a whole song took a minute; that turned out to be Gemini's
// thinking tokens, and with those off the picture reverses — each request carries ~1.4s of fixed
// network cost, so splitting a song makes it slower. Measured end to end: 43 lines took 6.5s as
// three batches and 3.6s as one.
//
// The machinery stays because it costs nothing when unused and still covers the case one request
// cannot: output grows at roughly 18 tokens per line, so a very long lyric would otherwise run
// into SEGMENTATION_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS and truncate, failing the whole song instead of one batch.
