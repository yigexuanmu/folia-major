//
// A listening report is a write to a real music account, and a burst of implausible ones is what
// trips a provider's risk control. The tracker upstream already refuses to count audio that was not
// played; this refuses to SEND at a rate no listener could produce, whatever the tracker believed.

/** No listener finishes two songs inside this. A second report that soon is a bug, not a listen. */

 *
 * The NetEase transport has no timeout of its own, so a dead proxy, a sleeping serverless backend
 * or a black-holing firewall leaves the request pending forever. Without a deadline `inFlight` would
 * never clear and every later report in the session would be dropped as "still in flight" - the
 * feature would switch itself off silently. Losing the race does not cancel the request; it only
 * gives up the slot, which is the part that must not leak.
