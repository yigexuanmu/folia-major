// The "add the current song to a playlist" dialog: whether it is up, and whether it could do
// anything if it were.
//
// The dialog used to be a local useState inside UnifiedPanel, next to the star button that opened
// it, which meant it only existed while the player panel was mounted. It is a decision about the
// current song, not about the panel, so a command should be able to reach it from anywhere — and
// that requires the open state to outlive the panel.
//
// `availability` is published by the host rather than derived per caller: answering it needs the
// Navidrome playlist list, which is fetched, and two consumers each fetching it would be worse
// than one owner saying what it found.
