/**
 * Whether switching transitions on is worth interrupting for.
 *
 * Three ways to answer no, and they are three different reasons rather than one condition:
 *
 * - Not a desktop build. The browser cannot run either model no matter what it downloads, so a
 *   prompt there is an errand that does not exist - which is the same distinction the engine badge
 *   already draws between "a limit" and "something you can go and fix".
 * - The weights are already here. Asked of `modelsPresent()`, which the automix hook refreshes at
 *   startup, so a fresh launch with both files installed answers correctly without opening
 *   Settings first.
 * - The listener said not to ask again. That one is remembered rather than re-derived, because it
 *   is a preference and not a fact about the machine.
 *
 * Either model missing counts: the beat grid is what the crossfade mode reads for its alignment
 * too, so "I only use crossfade" is not a reason to be missing beat_this.
