// What is playing, and what the listener is being shown while it plays.
//
// Two layers, and the distinction is load-bearing:
//
//   raw     — what the machine is doing right now.
//   display — what the listener perceives. During an automix blend the outgoing deck is still
//             audible while the raw state has already moved on to the arriving track.
//
// The display layer is exported as *selectors*, never as stored fields. Keeping a second copy is
// how it drifts, and the drift is not subtle: the command palette once read the raw transport, so
// for the length of every blend its Play command paused and its Pause command did nothing.
//
// Nothing here is a per-frame value. Playback position, the lyric clock and the analyser bands are
// MotionValues in ./motionSignals and must stay there. `currentLineIndex` is the fastest field in
// this store and it only moves when the lyric line changes, guarded by a ref at the call site.
