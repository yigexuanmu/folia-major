 * Squares the card box for the square-card option, at constant area.
 *
 * The side is the geometric mean of the poster box, so the square card covers the same artwork
 * area the breakpoint was tuned to show — squaring by simply dropping the height instead loses a
 * third of the card and leaves the wall looking sparse. Each axis' spacing then scales by that
 * axis' own change, which keeps every gap in proportion and keeps the grid cell's area identical.
 *
 * The two scale factors multiply to exactly 1, so the wall's radial density is unchanged and
 * `maxDistance` / `lodStart` / `lodEnd` need no adjustment: a card N rings out sits where it did.
