// to list every song-scoped input in their create effect's dependency array, so a track change
// destroyed the WebGL context, the texture pool and the whole scene cache and rebuilt them from
// scratch - with the canvas gone from the DOM for the whole async build. Here the runtime is
// created once and a song change is handed to it in place, the same way tuning changes already
// were, while the outgoing song keeps rendering until the runtime is ready to swap.
