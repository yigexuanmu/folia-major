// src/components/visualizer/pixiTextureBudget.ts
// Snaps a renderer resolution down to Pixi's power-of-two texture pool, so a full-viewport
// filter pass stops paying for pixels nothing ever draws into.
//
// `TexturePool.getOptimalTexture` rounds every render target up to a power of two per axis
// (`nextPow2(ceil(frame * resolution - 1e-6))`) and keys the pool on that pair. A pass is
// therefore billed for the *bucket*, not for the frame: at the default `textureResolution` of
// 1.5 an 781x850 viewport rasterises to 1172x1275 and lands in a 2048x2048 texture - 16 MiB
// holding 5.7 MiB of picture, 71% of it waste. Tempera and sonnet each run several such passes
// plus the pooled copies the inversion filter's backdrop needs, so the waste multiplies.
//
// The cost is a step function, which is the part that is easy to get wrong: measured on an
// Intel iGPU, growing the window from 640x640 to 700x700 (+18% area) raised tempera's resident
// GEM from 628 to 822 MiB (+31%), because 1.5x700 crosses 1024 and every pooled target doubles
// on both axes at once. Nothing about the picture changed to justify that.
//
// So instead of lowering the resolution across the board - which costs sharpness everywhere and
// still lands in whatever bucket it lands in - this gives back only the resolution that buys a
// smaller bucket. On that same 781x850 viewport it returns 1.2047 rather than 1.5: 20% softer,
// but the pooled targets go 2048x2048 -> 1024x1024, a quarter of the memory, and the frame now
// fills 92% of its texture instead of 29%. Sharpness per byte goes up, not down.
//
// Deliberately conservative: it only ever considers a *single* step down per axis, and only
// accepts one inside `TEXTURE_POOL_MAX_RESOLUTION_DROP`. A viewport whose nearest boundary is
// far away (2000x1200 at 1.5 would need 1.024, a 32% drop) keeps the resolution it asked for -
// paying for the bucket is the lesser evil there.
