// expensive per track. The parent clears lyrics to [] on a switch and fills them in a few
// renders later, so a mode that follows `seed` directly rebuilds against an empty song and
// pops its words in afterwards. Everything below runs on a COMMITTED song that lags the real
// one until the new one is ready.

 * added. Without this the signature could not see that, the gate answered `idle`, and the new
 * split did not reach the screen until the song changed. It also covers the load order where the
 * stored record resolves after the lyrics and is patched onto them (useLyricWordSegmentation).
 *
 * Hashing has to describe the split itself, not just how many lines carry one: re-running the AI
 * or hand-editing a line leaves the coverage count untouched while changing what gets drawn.
 * Boundary LENGTHS are enough, since the boundaries always join back to the line's own text.
 *
 * Numeric FNV-1a rather than the string key in wordSegmentation.ts because this runs over every
 * line on every render of the modes that use it, and must not build a string per pass. Lyrics with
 * no saved split cost one null check per line and always fold to the same constant.
