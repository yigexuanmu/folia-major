// Pixi bills a filter pass for its power-of-two pool bucket, not for the frame inside it, so the
// cost of `textureResolution` is a step function: on an Intel iGPU, growing tempera's window
// from 640x640 to 700x700 (+18% area) took resident GEM from 628 to 822 MiB, purely because
// 1.5x700 crosses 1024. These lock the snap that gives back only the resolution that buys a
// smaller bucket, and - just as important - the refusal to snap when the boundary is far away.
